The following code was written as a submission for [selection task](https://internshala.com/internship/detail/data-science-work-from-home-job-internship-at-blackcoffer1677143584) by Blackcoffer listed at Internshala. 

### *It is advised not to take help from this repository if the firm happens to enlist the same selection task again.*

The assets folder contains the [objective](/assets/Objective.docx.pdf) and [instructions](/assets/Text%20Analysis.docx.pdf) regarding performing the required text analysis.

The [text file](/Instructions.txt) was written as a part of the submission.

The [output](/OUTPUT.xlsx) was obtained for the given [input](/Input.csv) file. The correctness of the output could not be verified since there's no ideal solution to compare it to. 

However, I plan to go through the code again to debug any possible miscalculations or errors in it later.
